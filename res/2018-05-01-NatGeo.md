# What are the common colors of nature?

Everyone know natgeo, they're great. I think if there is one group that can tell us what earth looks like, it's them.

To this end I was curious about what the primary color compostion photos of their work were. So What I did was I scraped their instgram acound and pulled all their photos ~10000. And chopped them up to look for the most common colors.
Using adapted code from elsewhere, I applied k-means esitmation to parse out what the most common colors from each photo were.

I took the top five colors from each photo and compiled them across all photos.

In addition, I excluded black and white from the analysis. I only care about the colors used.

### Conclusion
Just as with action stars getting reused in blockbuster cinema, it appears there is a culture of employing the same actors in the award targeting niche.
