### Using Synthetic Biology to Understand the Utility of Active Degradation

What is the utility of active degradation bacterial genetic networks and how can synthetic biology help us tease out its role in bet-hedging systems? Using a combination of synthetic reporter plasmids and mathematical modeling we investigate this problem.

## Phenotypic diversity in isogenic bacteria can help survive unexpected antibiotic stress
As shown in [this fantastic paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep19538), even bacteria that are genetically identical can demonstrate differing susceptibility to antibiotics.

The video below shows a growing bacterial microcolony that's hit with a temporary dose of carbenicillin. Red coloration is a propidium iodide indication of cell death. Cyan represents diversity in a transcriptional reporter for the multiple antibiotic resistance activator MarA

We see that some cells die and others live - the cells that live go on to reproduce the same diversity. Moreover we see that this survivorship is correlated with MarA level. From [literature](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15009903), we know that MarA is actively degraded by Lon protease. How does turnover in MarA affect the distribution of the resistance phenotype?

## Not all phenotypic distributions are made equally

Consider the following distributions

Produced by the following [stationary ergodic processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_ergodic_process).

Even though the distributions have the same statistics, we see that the processes that produce each distribution are changing differently in time.

This difference can be described by the metric correlation time, which is to say how well knowing the state of the processes now informs where it will be in the future. For instance, pure white noise has a correlation time of 0 minutes - knowing where it is now does not inform at all where it will be in the future.

## How does a bacterial populations go from a few cells to rich phenotypic diversity?

![diversity](/res/blog_7/diversity.png)

We can model the development of diversity in noisy genes by an [Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_process)

<center>
$$\frac{dX}{dt} = -\theta_{x} X_{t} dt+\sigma_{x} \eta_{x}$$
</center>

Where $$\theta_{x}$$ scales with the half-life of the molecule.

Below we see simulation of several trajectories as well as the analytical solutions to the variance over time of the function for a short half-life activator. Mouse over the trajectories to highlight them.

Increasing the half-life of the activator demonstrates a slower accumulation of diversity over time.

## Active degradation increases the rate of diversity accumulation

Mirroring the computational results, experimental results for activators with differing half-lives demonstrate different rates of diversity generation. Here we compare a system with wild type MarA that is actively degraded to a system with synthetically modified MarA that is not.

## Conclusion / Complete Poster
So far we've only discussed diversity in an activator, but MarA doesn't operate in isolation, it goes on to activate multiple downstream genes to coordinate a cohesive resistance phenoptype.
